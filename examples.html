                            <p>Use this endpoint to create your first master user, follow the flow and you will get the token that will release you from the API security locks in swagger. We also explain how to verify that an existing user already exists in the database. Furthermore, we also show you how to obtain the data of the created user using its token. Lastly, we show you how to update any user data field, as well as how to log in successfully, change its password or finally how to delete any user from the system. Follow all these steps and you will have control of your users at you new platform.</p>

                            <p>Use this endpoint to log in your users and if their token expires, how can you refresh or recover it.   You need to refresh the token when it expires or when your first call with a valid token returns 401.</p>

                            <p>Use this endpoint to administer what we call "Segments", which are logical database instances that are assigned to particular master users. With this you can segment your users by profiles, roles or any type of logical segmentation that you require in your platform database. Likewise, we show you an example of the methods to create, update, obtain a segment or a list of paginated segments, as well as being able to delete a segment at any time.</p>
